### ORGANISATION:

* Check whether it is good practice for header files to include other header files, or if it is better to define the signatures of classes and structures we want to use.
* Change the configuration file format to JSON or XML.


### TECHNICALITIES:

* store sprite IDs and animation IDs to later delete them.
* add a Background class, can have multiple layers of sprites
<!-- * add an animated class, to have an animation instead of a simple static image, or to have a static image without animation -->

### FURTHER DEVELOPEMENT:

* Add some utility classes and functions (Vector).
<!-- * Finish the Sprite and Animation class. -->
* Add Character classes.
<!-- * Add rudimentary input handling. -->
<!-- * Fine tune the game loop (variable time steps). -->
<!-- * Add physics (gravity, object collision ...). -->
* Add logic (alive, dead, health).
* Add camera for selectively rendering entities.
